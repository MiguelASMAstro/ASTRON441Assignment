This repository contains two components. 

1. `Orbit.py` contains code that solves the equations of motion for a test particle around a massive body in units G=M=a=1. This includes Euler and RK4 integration schemes, adaptive timestepping, and KS regularization. 

2. `TwoBodyRegularized.ipynb` is a tutorial that explains the theory and use of the above code with ample examples.

Required packages: `numpy`,`matplotlib`
